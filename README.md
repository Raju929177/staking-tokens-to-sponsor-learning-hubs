# P2P Book Rental

## Project Title
**P2P Book Rental**

## Project Description
The **P2P Book Rental** smart contract allows users to list their books for rent and rent books from others directly on the blockchain. The contract ensures that the rental price is paid upfront by the renter and facilitates the transfer of the rental fee to the book owner. The smart contract tracks the availability of the books and ensures that rented books are no longer available until marked as available again.

## Project Vision
The **P2P Book Rental** project aims to provide a decentralized platform for book renting, empowering individuals to rent and lend books directly without intermediaries. By leveraging smart contracts, it guarantees a transparent and trustless interaction between renters and owners, ensuring fair transactions and availability checks. The long-term vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem where readers can easily access and rent books at affordable prices, while owners can monetize their personal libraries.

## Key Features
1. **Decentralized Book Listings**: Users can list books they own and want to rent out. Each book has a rental price and availability status.
2. **Rental Transactions**: Renters can rent a book by sending the required rental fee. The contract ensures that the correct rental fee is paid to the owner.
3. **Book Availability Management**: Once a book is rented, it is marked as unavailable until the owner manually makes it available again.
4. **Transparent and Trustless**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust between the renter and the book owner.
5. **Simple Interface**: The contract has two main functionsâ€”`listBook` for owners to list books and `rentBook` for renters to rent books. This makes the contract simple to use and understand.
